# 🏃‍♂️Miles to Kilometer Converter App using Tkinter of Python

🌟A GUI based app which converts the input miles data into equivalent kilometer value.

👉The use of Tkinter module for the GUI implementation of the program. Various classes from the tkinter module 
like Label, Entry, Button and Tk are used.

👉The Label class helps design the text labels on the window.

👉The Entry class provides the text-entry field for user interaction.

👉The Button class designs the button to execute the conversion which occurs beecause of the keyword argument 
which calls the conversion function defined in the program.

👉The Tk class creates the window for the app, where all these objects are displayed. The positioning of all the 
objects on the window is done using the grid method i.e. w.r.t. rows & columns and padding is added to the window for better visuality.
